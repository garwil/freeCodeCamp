# freeCodeCamp
My solutions to various freeCodeCamp assignments. Released under the GPL in the hope that someone will find them useful! The code might not be perfect and I know for certain there are parts that could be greatly improved, but it should all work. If you found anything useful or spotted any glaring errors that it's vital I correct, please let me know!
